##This project explores the combination of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) and Model Predictive Control (MPC) in the highway-env environment.
The goal is to train autonomous driving agents that are both adaptive (via RL) and safe / robust (via MPC).

#Features
Training RL agents (e.g., DQN, PPO, etc.) in highway-env.
Integration of MPC for short-term trajectory optimization and safety guarantees.
Example training and testing scripts with configurable parameters.
Support for simulation and result visualization.
