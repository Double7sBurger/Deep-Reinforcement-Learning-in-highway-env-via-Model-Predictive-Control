# This project explores the combination of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) and Model Predictive Control (MPC) in the highway-env environment.
The goal is to train autonomous driving agents that are both adaptive (via RL) and safe / robust (via MPC). The Simulation environment is Gym highway-env.

## Features
1. Training RL agents (e.g., DQN, PPO, etc.) in highway-env.
2. Integration of MPC for short-term trajectory optimization and safety guarantees.
3. Using ConvLSTM to improve the overall safety performance.
4. Example training and testing scripts with configurable parameters.
5. Support for simulation and result visualization.
